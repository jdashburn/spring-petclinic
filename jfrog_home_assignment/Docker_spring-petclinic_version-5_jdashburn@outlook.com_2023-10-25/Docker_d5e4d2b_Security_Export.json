An [R-Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-tree) is a special index that is designed for doing range queries.

Given a query rectangle, an R-Tree is able to quickly find all entries that are contained within the query rectangle or which overlap the query rectangle.\n\nEven though no exploit is published, it's possible in theory to cause a heap out-of-bound read using a crafted rtree table, leading to potential disclosure of information.",

            "FullDescription": "[Curl](https://curl.se/) is a command-line tool for transferring data from or to a server, using various protocols like HTTP, FTP, SMTP, and more.\n[HTTP Strict Transport Security](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/HTTP_strict_transport_security) (HSTS) is a simple and widely supported standard to protect visitors by ensuring that their browsers always connect to a website over HTTPS. HSTS exists to remove the need for the common, insecure practice of redirecting users from `http://` to `https://` URLs.\n\nCurl supports `HSTS` local cache which can be used through the command line using the following syntax: `curl --hsts hsts.txt https://hsts.example.com`.\nCurl also supports caching these `HSTS` headers in-memory instead of a file, by using the following syntax: `curl --hsts \"\" https://hsts.example.com`\n\nIt was discovered that when using the in-memory HSTS caching (`--hsts \"\"`) of curl, if more than one URL of the same domain is passed to the curl command line, and at least one of them (except the first one) starts with `http://` instead of `https://`, the request sent by curl will bypass the `HSTS` filter and use the insecure clear-text HTTP protocol.\nThis is despite the fact that the `--hsts` option should force the use of HTTPS.\n\nFor example, the following command line is insecure (take note of the use of in-memory HSTS caching and the same domain URLs): `curl --hsts \"\" https://hsts.example.com http://hsts.example.com`\n\nNote: only the curl command line using the `--hsts` option is vulnerable. `libcurl` is not affected by this vulnerability.",

This would give the attacker the ability to perform Man in the Middle on non-encrypted clear text communication, which is easier compared to encrypted communication when HTTPS is used.\n3. The vulnerable application or server should execute `curl` that would make multiple requests to the same domain in a single Curl command, which is not common. Alternatively, the attacker should be able to control the requested URL that `curl` access and set it.",

            "ShortDescription": "Incorrect IP parsing in Python ipaddress module can lead to IP address confusion.",
            "FullDescription": "In Python's built-in `ipaddress` module, when parsing IPv4 strings, leading zeros are incorrectly ignored and are not assumed to specify octal (base 8) octets. IP addresses are left stripped instead of evaluated as valid octal IP addresses. This behavior is problematic since many other tools (such as Bash) can properly handle octal IP addresses.\n\nAn attacker can exploit this vulnerability if Python is used with the  `ipaddress.ip_address` or `ipaddress.ip_network` functions for parsing an IP address received as a string from user input.\n\nThe impact from this vulnerability is an IP address confusion between two different components:\n\n1. Python’s `ipaddress` module which will misinterpret an octal IP address \n2. Some other IP address parser that correctly handles octal IP addresses, such as Bash. \n\nFor example, in the following PoC the 1st `ping` invocation will access ip address \"8.8.8.8\" but the 2nd invocation will (incorrectly) access \"10.8.8.8\":\n\n```\nSUSPECT = '010.8.8.8'\nBAD_IP = ipaddress.ip_address(SUSPECT)\nsubprocess.check_output(\"ping -W3 -v -c1 \"+str(SUSPECT), shell=True, universal_newlines=True)\nsubprocess.check_output(\"ping -W3 -v -c1 \"+str(BAD_IP), shell=True, universal_newlines=True)\n```",

            "FullDescription": "[Vim](https://www.vim.org/) is a free, open-source, screen-based text editor program for Unix.\nVim has an `Ex mode` that allows entering Ex commands and is designed for Batch processing.\n\nThe Ex, or colon, commands are based on the line editor named ex. In general, they operate on the document as a whole, or large portions of it (although there are commands to perform essentially every editing task).\n\nIt was discovered that when sourcing a file using Vim `Ex mode`, a heap overflow may occur, which leads to a denial of service.\n\n`vim` can be run with one or more flags. These flags include, but are not limited to:\n\n* `-e`: With the `-e` flag, the user enters Ex mode. The Ex mode is similar to the command line mode as it also allows you to enter Ex commands.\n* `-s`: With the `-s` flag, the user can silence the ex mode, to support batch commands.\n* `-S`: With the `-S` flag, the user sources the file after loading it.\n\nThe issue requires the victim to run an attacker's specially crafted file in `Ex mode` and source it as well.\nAn example of a vulnerable command line:\n`vim -e -s -S {malicious_file}`\n\nOpening files with vim in this specific mode is highly unlikely.\n\nThis vulnerability has no security impact at all since if an attacker can run arbitrary vim commands, then the attacker can also execute arbitrary shell commands using the exclamation mark, and does not need this vulnerability to achieve code execution. For example running the vim command `!ls` will execute the shell command `ls`.",

Since hostnames are often supplied by remote servers that could be controlled by an attacker, the vulnerability could be exploited by triggering the CPU consumption on a client attempting to process a crafted, unreasonably long name.\n\nNote that according to IDNA specifications, the IDNA label names cannot be more than 63 ASCII characters.

At most, it can only impact applications relying specifically on Telnet options but not the data sent to the server.\n\nExample vulnerable invocation -\n`curl --telnet-option NEW_ENV=a,b$(echo -ne \"\\xff\\xf0INJECTED\") telnet://server`\nThe above example will inject the \"INJECTED\" command",

One of its core functions, `urlparse`, incorrectly parses URL that start with blank characters, causing any blacklisting methods based on the parsed scheme to fail, as shown in the following example where the `input_scheme` is blank -\n```py\nfrom urllib.parse import urlparse\n\ninput_scheme = urlparse(\" file://127.0.0.1/etc/passwd\").scheme\nprint(input_scheme)\n```\nThe `input_scheme` value is ` ` instead of the expected value of `file`.",

            "ShortDescription": "Insufficient input validation in findmatch() function of the Python mailcap module, allows attackers to perform remote code execution.",
            "FullDescription": "The [mailcap](https://docs.python.org/2/library/mailcap.html) library is part of the Python Standard Library ([CPython](https://github.com/python/cpython)). The library is responsible for configuring how MIME-aware applications such as mail readers and Web browsers handle files with different [MIME types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_type). \n\nThe library implementation has a bug in the `mailcap.findmatch()` function, where the `filename` argument is not being sanitized and added as-is to the command line string that is returned from the function. This command line is then usually executed by the application that uses the library to invoke the program that handles the MIME type. If the library is used as a command line tool, this invocation happens automatically by the function `test()` that executes the MIME program automatically to test its return value.\n\nThe vulnerability can be exploited if the `findmatch()` function is used and no external user input validation is implemented. In that state, the vulnerability may be exploited by injecting shell commands into the `filename` argument, which will likely be executed later. \n\nExample of injecting shell command into `filename` argument when using the library in Python code: \n```\ncommandline, MIMEtype = mailcap.findmatch(\n    d, \"text/*\", filename=\"'filename; echo HACKED'\"\n)\nos.system(commandline)\n```\n\nExample of automatic execution of the injected shell when using the library as a standalone tool:\n```\npython3 -m mailcap text/html 'filename; echo HACKED'\n```\n\nThe original issue was discovered in 2015, and although a patch was suggested by a maintainer this year it remained an issue until in 2022 the CVE was published since it was discovered that the `mailcap.findmatch()` function is still exploitable. As a result, the CPython team updated the `mailcap.findmatch()` function to disable ASCII characters other than alphanumerics and `@+=:,./-_` from being injected into the returned command line\".",

            "Resolution": "##### Development mitigations\n\nIf possible, avoid using the library for MIME type handling.\nIf not, sanitize the data that is passed to `filename` parameter of `findmatch()` before calling the function with user-supplied input. It is recommended to sanitize any non-alphanumeric characters to avoid command injections to this argument.",

This command line is then usually executed by the application that uses the library to invoke the program that handles the MIME type. If the library is used as a command line tool, this invocation happens automatically by the function `test()` that executes the MIME program automatically to test its return value.\n\nThe vulnerability can be exploited if the `findmatch()` function is used and no external user input validation is implemented.

            "ShortDescription": "Insufficient input validation in findmatch() function of the Python mailcap module, allows attackers to perform remote code execution.",
            "FullDescription": "The [mailcap](https://docs.python.org/2/library/mailcap.html) library is part of the Python Standard Library ([CPython](https://github.com/python/cpython)). The library is responsible for configuring how MIME-aware applications such as mail readers and Web browsers handle files with different [MIME types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_type). \n\nThe library implementation has a bug in the `mailcap.findmatch()` function, where the `filename` argument is not being sanitized and added as-is to the command line string that is returned from the function. This command line is then usually executed by the application that uses the library to invoke the program that handles the MIME type. If the library is used as a command line tool, this invocation happens automatically by the function `test()` that executes the MIME program automatically to test its return value.\n\nThe vulnerability can be exploited if the `findmatch()` function is used and no external user input validation is implemented. In that state, the vulnerability may be exploited by injecting shell commands into the `filename` argument, which will likely be executed later. \n\nExample of injecting shell command into `filename` argument when using the library in Python code: \n```\ncommandline, MIMEtype = mailcap.findmatch(\n    d, \"text/*\", filename=\"'filename; echo HACKED'\"\n)\nos.system(commandline)\n```\n\nExample of automatic execution of the injected shell when using the library as a standalone tool:\n```\npython3 -m mailcap text/html 'filename; echo HACKED'\n```\n\nThe original issue was discovered in 2015, and although a patch was suggested by a maintainer this year it remained an issue until in 2022 the CVE was published since it was discovered that the `mailcap.findmatch()` function is still exploitable. As a result, the CPython team updated the `mailcap.findmatch()` function to disable ASCII characters other than alphanumerics and `@+=:,./-_` from being injected into the returned command line\".",

It is recommended to sanitize any non-alphanumeric characters to avoid command injections to this argument.",

            "FullDescription": "Python `multiprocessing` is a package that supports spawning processes using an API similar to the threading module. It supports three ways to start a process: `spawn`,`fork`, and `forkserver`.\n\nIt was discovered that the library, when used with the `forkserver` start method on Linux, can result in local privilege escalation.\n\nThis may happen when the `forkserver` is using Linux abstract namespace sockets, which is the default on Linux in Python 3.9 and Python 3.10.\nLinux abstract sockets lack any form of permissions so their use allows any process in the same host-local network namespace (which means any user on the system in many default configurations) to communicate with them.\n\nThe `forkserver` is deserializing Python pickles being sent on those sockets, and pickles can execute code.\n\nTherefore, this allows local user privilege escalation to the user that any Python multiprocessing `forkserver` process is running.\n\nThe `forkserver` start method for multiprocessing is not the default start method. This issue is Linux specific because only Linux supports abstract namespace sockets.\n\nAlthough in Python 3.9 and 3.10 Linux abstract namespace sockets are the default communication method with the `forkserver`, it is not the default in Python 3.7 and 3.8.\nSupport for users manually specifying an abstract namespace socket was added as a [bugfix](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/84031) in 3.7.8 and 3.8.3, but users would need to make specific uncommon multiprocessing API calls specifying their own `forkserver` control socket path in order to do that in Python before 3.9 - which makes the applicability of this CVE very rare in Python 3.8 and 3.7.",

            "ShortDescription": "A heap buffer overflow in ncurses may lead to local privilege escalation when a setuid application parses a crafted terminfo database.",
            "FullDescription": "ncurses is a programming library that allows developers to create text-based user interfaces in a terminal or console window. It provides functions for controlling the cursor, displaying text and graphics, and handling user input, and is widely used in Unix-like operating systems for building cross-platform command-line applications.\nThe `terminfo` file is a database that stores information about terminal types and their capabilities.  By default, ncurses will search `${HOME}/.terminfo` first, then `/etc/terminfo`, then `/lib/terminfo`, and\n finally `/usr/share/terminfo`.\n\nTerminfo allows to declare user definable attributes, custom numbers or strings thatextend its standard capabilities.\nUsers can customize their own terminfo definitions by creating or modifying files within their `.terminfo`. \nThe `.terminfo` directory is typically located at `$HOME/.terminfo`, and users have the necessary privileges to modify the files within this directory. The default location can be overwritten by defining the `$TERMINFO` or `$TERM` environment variable.\nExample: `export TERMINFO=/my/terminfo/db/path`\n\nAn issue was discovered in the ncurses library's `_nc_read_termtype` function, responsible for parsing terminfo database file due to improper handling of heap allocation for `Strings` and `Extended Strings` within the `terminfo` file. The function fails to handle the allocation correctly, leading to a heap buffer overflow, which can result in memory corruption issues.\nDue to the nature of the vulnerability, an attacker would mainly try to get local privilege escalation. Then, the only binaries that are vulnerable to this issue are the `SetUID binaries` that are using `ncurses`. \n \nThe exposed functions that call the `_nc_read_termtype` function are: `_nc_read_file_entry`, `initscr`, `setupterm` and `resttarterm` functions.\n\nNote that this issue can also be triggered by the ncurses's progs tools like `infocmp` and `tic`. However, they're not `setuid` binaries so they cannot be used for a privilege escalation.",

Common examples include `.bashrc` for `Bash`, `.bash_profile` for `Bash login shells`, and `.profile` for `POSIX-compliant shells`. The file is typically located in the user's home directory.\n2. Open the file with `root` access\n3. Add the following line to make the TERMINFO environment variable un-writtable: \n```\nexport TERMINFO=\nreadonly TERMINFO\n```\n4.

            "FullDescription": "ncurses is a programming library that allows developers to create text-based user interfaces in a terminal or console window. It provides functions for controlling the cursor, displaying text and graphics, and handling user input, and is widely used in Unix-like operating systems for building cross-platform command-line applications.\nThe `terminfo` file is a database that stores information about terminal types and their capabilities.  By default, ncurses will search `${HOME}/.terminfo` first, then `/etc/terminfo`, then `/lib/terminfo`, and\n finally `/usr/share/terminfo`.\n\nTerminfo allows to declare user definable attributes, custom numbers or strings thatextend its standard capabilities.\nUsers can customize their own terminfo definitions by creating or modifying files within their `.terminfo`. \nThe `.terminfo` directory is typically located at `$HOME/.terminfo`, and users have the necessary privileges to modify the files within this directory. The default location can be overwritten by defining the `$TERMINFO` or `$TERM` environment variable.\nExample: `export TERMINFO=/my/terminfo/db/path`\n\nAn issue was discovered in the ncurses library's `_nc_read_termtype` function, responsible for parsing terminfo database file due to improper handling of heap allocation for `Strings` and `Extended Strings` within the `terminfo` file. The function fails to handle the allocation correctly, leading to a heap buffer overflow, which can result in memory corruption issues.\nDue to the nature of the vulnerability, an attacker would mainly try to get local privilege escalation. Then, the only binaries that are vulnerable to this issue are the `SetUID binaries` that are using `ncurses`. \n \nThe exposed functions that call the `_nc_read_termtype` function are: `_nc_read_file_entry`, `initscr`, `setupterm` and `resttarterm` functions.\n\nNote that this issue can also be triggered by the ncurses's progs tools like `infocmp` and `tic`.

            "FullDescription": "[Vim](https://www.vim.org/) is a free, open-source, screen-based text editor program for Unix.\nVim has an `Ex mode` that allows entering Ex commands and is designed for Batch processing.\n\nThe Ex, or colon, commands are based on the line editor named ex. In general, they operate on the document as a whole, or large portions of it (although there are commands to perform essentially every editing task).\n\nIt was discovered that when sourcing a file using Vim `Ex mode`, a heap overflow may occur, which leads to a denial of service.\n\n`vim` can be run with one or more flags. These flags include, but are not limited to:\n\n* `-e`: With the `-e` flag, the user enters Ex mode. The Ex mode is similar to the command line mode as it also allows you to enter Ex commands.\n* `-s`: With the `-s` flag, the user can silence the ex mode, to support batch commands.\n* `-S`: With the `-S` flag, the user sources the file after loading it.\n\nThe issue requires the victim to run an attacker's specially crafted file in `Ex mode` and source it as well.\nAn example of a vulnerable command line:\n`vim -e -s -S {malicious_file}`\n\nOpening files with vim in this specific mode is highly unlikely.\n\nThis vulnerability has no security impact at all since if an attacker can run arbitrary vim commands, then the attacker can also execute arbitrary shell commands using the exclamation mark, and does not need this vulnerability to achieve code execution. For example running the vim command `!ls` will execute the shell command `ls`.",

            "FullDescription": "[Vim](https://www.vim.org/) is a free, open-source, screen-based text editor program for Unix.\nVim has an `Ex mode` that allows entering Ex commands and is designed for Batch processing.\n\nThe Ex, or colon, commands are based on the line editor named ex. In general, they operate on the document as a whole, or large portions of it (although there are commands to perform essentially every editing task).\n\nIt was discovered that when sourcing a file using Vim `Ex mode`, a heap overflow may occur, which leads to a denial of service.\n\n`vim` can be run with one or more flags. These flags include, but are not limited to:\n\n* `-e`: With the `-e` flag, the user enters Ex mode. The Ex mode is similar to the command line mode as it also allows you to enter Ex commands.\n* `-s`: With the `-s` flag, the user can silence the ex mode, to support batch commands.\n* `-S`: With the `-S` flag, the user sources the file after loading it.\n\nThe issue requires the victim to run an attacker's specially crafted file in `Ex mode` and source it as well.\nAn example of a vulnerable command line:\n`vim -e -s -S {malicious_file}`\n\nOpening files with vim in this specific mode is highly unlikely.\n\nThis vulnerability has no security impact at all since if an attacker can run arbitrary vim commands, then the attacker can also execute arbitrary shell commands using the exclamation mark, and does not need this vulnerability to achieve code execution. For example running the vim command `!ls` will execute the shell command `ls`.",

            "ShortDescription": "Insufficient permissions check in Python 3.7, 3.8, 3.9 and 3.10 on Linux may lead to privilege escalation when using the non-default 'forkserver' start method of the 'multiprocessing' module.",
            "FullDescription": "Python `multiprocessing` is a package that supports spawning processes using an API similar to the threading module. It supports three ways to start a process: `spawn`,`fork`, and `forkserver`.\n\nIt was discovered that the library, when used with the `forkserver` start method on Linux, can result in local privilege escalation.\n\nThis may happen when the `forkserver` is using Linux abstract namespace sockets, which is the default on Linux in Python 3.9 and Python 3.10.\nLinux abstract sockets lack any form of permissions so their use allows any process in the same host-local network namespace (which means any user on the system in many default configurations) to communicate with them.\n\nThe `forkserver` is deserializing Python pickles being sent on those sockets, and pickles can execute code.\n\nTherefore, this allows local user privilege escalation to the user that any Python multiprocessing `forkserver` process is running.\n\nThe `forkserver` start method for multiprocessing is not the default start method. This issue is Linux specific because only Linux supports abstract namespace sockets.\n\nAlthough in Python 3.9 and 3.10 Linux abstract namespace sockets are the default communication method with the `forkserver`, it is not the default in Python 3.7 and 3.8.\nSupport for users manually specifying an abstract namespace socket was added as a [bugfix](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/84031) in 3.7.8 and 3.8.3, but users would need to make specific uncommon multiprocessing API calls specifying their own `forkserver` control socket path in order to do that in Python before 3.9 - which makes the applicability of this CVE very rare in Python 3.8 and 3.7.",

You must execute that before anything else in your process.\n\n\nAlternatives to avoid the problem:\nIf your Linux Python application can be switched from multiprocessing's `.set_start_method(\"forkserver\")` to a start method such as `\"spawn\"` that will also avoid this issue.",

            "ShortDescription": "Insufficient permissions check in Python 3.7, 3.8, 3.9 and 3.10 on Linux may lead to privilege escalation when using the non-default 'forkserver' start method of the 'multiprocessing' module.",
            "FullDescription": "Python `multiprocessing` is a package that supports spawning processes using an API similar to the threading module. It supports three ways to start a process: `spawn`,`fork`, and `forkserver`.\n\nIt was discovered that the library, when used with the `forkserver` start method on Linux, can result in local privilege escalation.\n\nThis may happen when the `forkserver` is using Linux abstract namespace sockets, which is the default on Linux in Python 3.9 and Python 3.10.\nLinux abstract sockets lack any form of permissions so their use allows any process in the same host-local network namespace (which means any user on the system in many default configurations) to communicate with them.\n\nThe `forkserver` is deserializing Python pickles being sent on those sockets, and pickles can execute code.\n\nTherefore, this allows local user privilege escalation to the user that any Python multiprocessing `forkserver` process is running.\n\nThe `forkserver` start method for multiprocessing is not the default start method. This issue is Linux specific because only Linux supports abstract namespace sockets.\n\nAlthough in Python 3.9 and 3.10 Linux abstract namespace sockets are the default communication method with the `forkserver`, it is not the default in Python 3.7 and 3.8.\nSupport for users manually specifying an abstract namespace socket was added as a [bugfix](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/84031) in 3.7.8 and 3.8.3, but users would need to make specific uncommon multiprocessing API calls specifying their own `forkserver` control socket path in order to do that in Python before 3.9 - which makes the applicability of this CVE very rare in Python 3.8 and 3.7.",

You must execute that before anything else in your process.\n\n\nAlternatives to avoid the problem:\nIf your Linux Python application can be switched from multiprocessing's `.set_start_method(\"forkserver\")` to a start method such as `\"spawn\"` that will also avoid this issue.",

            "FullDescription": "Python `multiprocessing` is a package that supports spawning processes using an API similar to the threading module. It supports three ways to start a process: `spawn`,`fork`, and `forkserver`.\n\nIt was discovered that the library, when used with the `forkserver` start method on Linux, can result in local privilege escalation.\n\nThis may happen when the `forkserver` is using Linux abstract namespace sockets, which is the default on Linux in Python 3.9 and Python 3.10.\nLinux abstract sockets lack any form of permissions so their use allows any process in the same host-local network namespace (which means any user on the system in many default configurations) to communicate with them.\n\nThe `forkserver` is deserializing Python pickles being sent on those sockets, and pickles can execute code.\n\nTherefore, this allows local user privilege escalation to the user that any Python multiprocessing `forkserver` process is running.\n\nThe `forkserver` start method for multiprocessing is not the default start method. This issue is Linux specific because only Linux supports abstract namespace sockets.\n\nAlthough in Python 3.9 and 3.10 Linux abstract namespace sockets are the default communication method with the `forkserver`, it is not the default in Python 3.7 and 3.8.\nSupport for users manually specifying an abstract namespace socket was added as a [bugfix](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/84031) in 3.7.8 and 3.8.3, but users would need to make specific uncommon multiprocessing API calls specifying their own `forkserver` control socket path in order to do that in Python before 3.9 - which makes the applicability of this CVE very rare in Python 3.8 and 3.7.",

            "ShortDescription": "An out-of-bounds read in SQLite can lead to denial of service when opening a crafted database file.",
            "FullDescription": "[SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) is a software library that provides a lightweight, self-contained, serverless, and transactional SQL database engine. It is widely used as an embedded database in various applications and devices due to its simplicity, reliability, and small footprint.\n[SQLite OS Interface or VFS (Virtual File System)](https://www.sqlite.org/vfs.html) is a component of SQLite that allows developers to customize the way SQLite interacts with the underlying file system. \nThe primary purpose of the VFS is to handle low-level file operations such as opening, reading, writing, and closing database files.\n\nWhen using the [appendvfs](http://www.sqlite.org/src/file/ext/misc/appendvfs.c) API to open an appended file, SQLite expects to find a database in the provided file, usually at the end of the appended file.\nHowever, if there is no SQLite database file in the appended file, the `apndOpen()` function of the `appendvfs` code tries to close an empty handle, causing an out-of-bounds read which leads to a denial of service.\nBy default, the sqlite library does not use the vulnerable `appendvfs` function. To use it, the extension `appendvfs` should be registered in the VFS list through either `sqlite3_appendvfs_init()` or `sqlite3_vfs_register()` functions.\n\nThe published [PoC](https://github.com/Tsiming/Vulnerabilities/blob/main/SQLite/CVE-2021-31239) leads to denial of service. \nThis issue can be triggered when opening the file with sqlite3 through the command line: `sqlite3 < poc`.\n\nExample of vulnerable code:\n```\nint main (void)\n{\n    sqlite3_appendvfs_init(0, 0, 0);\n    int flags = SQLITE_OPEN_READWRITE|SQLITE_OPEN_CREATE;\n    sqlite3 *db;\n    if (sqlite3_open_v2(\"poc\", &db, flags, \"apndvfs\") != SQLITE_OK) {\n        printf(\"%s\\n\", sqlite3_errmsg(db));\n    } else {\n       // in case it succeeds to open the file\n    }\n    sqlite3_close(db);\n    exit(0);\n}\n```\nThe `sqlite3_appendvfs_init()` function is registering the `appendvfs` extension to sqlite3.",

This bug can be used to inject arbitrary configuration into a user's `$GIT_DIR/config` when attempting to remove the configuration section associated with that submodule. When the attacker injects configuration values which specify executables to run (such as `core.pager`, `core.editor`, `core.sshCommand`, etc.) this can lead to a remote code execution. A fix A fix is available in versions 2.30.9, 2.31.8, 2.32.7, 2.33.8, 2.34.8, 2.35.8, 2.36.6, 2.37.7, 2.38.5, 2.39.3, and 2.40.1.

An attacker might be able to perform a timing attack to extract information about the private key by observing the time it takes to perform the encryption.\n\nTo perform this attack, an attacker would need to be on the same machine or subnet where the decryption takes place, and be able to trigger many decryption operations (oracle attack).",

            "ShortDescription": "Improper validation logic in CPAN leads to signature validation bypass when installing a module from an untrusted CPAN mirror.",
            "FullDescription": "[CPAN](https://www.cpan.org/) (Comprehensive Perl Archive Network) is a repository of over 200,000 modules for the Perl programming language. \n\nTo install Perl modules from CPAN, users can use either the `cpan` client provided by [CPAN.pm](https://metacpan.org/dist/CPAN) (included in the Perl core) or the `cpanm` client provided by [cpanminus](https://metacpan.org/pod/App::cpanminus).\n\nWhen downloading a module, the cpan client retrieves a tarball with an encrypted `CHECKSUMS` file. The client generates its own local `CHECKSUMS` file for the downloaded file and compares it to the downloaded CHECKSUMS file. **By default**, the client only compares the `CHECKSUMS` files content but **does not validate the authenticity of the downloaded `CHECKSUMS` file**. To enable this option in cpan, the user can run the following command: `o conf check_sigs 1` and to make the changes persistent, run `o conf commit` after the first command.\n\nHowever, even when signature checking is enabled, there is a flaw in the `CHECKSUMS` file validation logic. An attacker can add a prepended checksum for a modified package to the beginning of the `CHECKSUMS` file, which will cause the `Module::Signature::_verify()` function to pass and trigger the installation even though the return code is `CANNOT_VERIFY`, which will be considered as `SIGNATURE_OK`.\n\nThis issue can be used to carry out supply chain attacks, as demonstrated in the [PoC](https://blog.hackeriet.no/cpan-signature-verification-vulnerabilities/). The attacker must create their own CPAN mirror, change the targeted module to add its malicious behaviors, calculate the new checksums from its files and add the calculated checksum to the beginning of the associated `CHECKSUMS` file.",

            "FullDescription": "The [mailcap](https://docs.python.org/2/library/mailcap.html) library is part of the Python Standard Library ([CPython](https://github.com/python/cpython)). The library is responsible for configuring how MIME-aware applications such as mail readers and Web browsers handle files with different [MIME types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_type). \n\nThe library implementation has a bug in the `mailcap.findmatch()` function, where the `filename` argument is not being sanitized and added as-is to the command line string that is returned from the function. This command line is then usually executed by the application that uses the library to invoke the program that handles the MIME type. If the library is used as a command line tool, this invocation happens automatically by the function `test()` that executes the MIME program automatically to test its return value.\n\nThe vulnerability can be exploited if the `findmatch()` function is used and no external user input validation is implemented. In that state, the vulnerability may be exploited by injecting shell commands into the `filename` argument, which will likely be executed later. \n\nExample of injecting shell command into `filename` argument when using the library in Python code: \n```\ncommandline, MIMEtype = mailcap.findmatch(\n    d, \"text/*\", filename=\"'filename; echo HACKED'\"\n)\nos.system(commandline)\n```\n\nExample of automatic execution of the injected shell when using the library as a standalone tool:\n```\npython3 -m mailcap text/html 'filename; echo HACKED'\n```\n\nThe original issue was discovered in 2015, and although a patch was suggested by a maintainer this year it remained an issue until in 2022 the CVE was published since it was discovered that the `mailcap.findmatch()` function is still exploitable. As a result, the CPython team updated the `mailcap.findmatch()` function to disable ASCII characters other than alphanumerics and `@+=:,./-_` from being injected into the returned command line\".",

            "ShortDescription": "Insufficient input validation in findmatch() function of the Python mailcap module, allows attackers to perform remote code execution.",
            "FullDescription": "The [mailcap](https://docs.python.org/2/library/mailcap.html) library is part of the Python Standard Library ([CPython](https://github.com/python/cpython)). The library is responsible for configuring how MIME-aware applications such as mail readers and Web browsers handle files with different [MIME types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_type). \n\nThe library implementation has a bug in the `mailcap.findmatch()` function, where the `filename` argument is not being sanitized and added as-is to the command line string that is returned from the function. This command line is then usually executed by the application that uses the library to invoke the program that handles the MIME type. If the library is used as a command line tool, this invocation happens automatically by the function `test()` that executes the MIME program automatically to test its return value.\n\nThe vulnerability can be exploited if the `findmatch()` function is used and no external user input validation is implemented. In that state, the vulnerability may be exploited by injecting shell commands into the `filename` argument, which will likely be executed later. \n\nExample of injecting shell command into `filename` argument when using the library in Python code: \n```\ncommandline, MIMEtype = mailcap.findmatch(\n    d, \"text/*\", filename=\"'filename; echo HACKED'\"\n)\nos.system(commandline)\n```\n\nExample of automatic execution of the injected shell when using the library as a standalone tool:\n```\npython3 -m mailcap text/html 'filename; echo HACKED'\n```\n\nThe original issue was discovered in 2015, and although a patch was suggested by a maintainer this year it remained an issue until in 2022 the CVE was published since it was discovered that the `mailcap.findmatch()` function is still exploitable. As a result, the CPython team updated the `mailcap.findmatch()` function to disable ASCII characters other than alphanumerics and `@+=:,./-_` from being injected into the returned command line\".",

            "Resolution": "##### Development mitigations\n\nIf possible, avoid using the library for MIME type handling.\nIf not, sanitize the data that is passed to `filename` parameter of `findmatch()` before calling the function with user-supplied input. It is recommended to sanitize any non-alphanumeric characters to avoid command injections to this argument.",

By default, it does not verify TLS certificates. To enable it, the `verify_SSL=>1` flag should be specified when initializing the `HTTP::Tiny` object. The problem identified in `HTTP::Tiny` has been assigned the CVE identifier `CVE-2023-31486` and serves as the underlying cause for the problem in `CPAN.pm`.\n\n`CPAN.pm` downloads and executes code through the `install` command followed by the package name.\nAlthough `CPAN.pm` downloads from `https://cpan.org`, it does not enable TLS certificate verification while using `HTTP::Tiny`, which could potentially allow an attacker to perform a man-in-the-middle attack by injecting malicious data that could be executed by CPAN.pm.\n\nExample of a vulnerable code:\n```\nuse CPAN;\ninstall DateTime\n```\n\nExample of a vulnerable command-line:\n```\ncpan install DateTime\n```",

These flags include, but are not limited to:\n\n* `-e`: With the `-e` flag, the user enters Ex mode. The Ex mode is similar to the command line mode as it also allows you to enter Ex commands.\n* `-s`: With the `-s` flag, the user can silence the ex mode, to support batch commands.\n* `-S`: With the `-S` flag, the user sources the file after loading it.\n\nThe issue requires the victim to run an attacker's specially crafted file in `Ex mode` and source it as well.\nAn example of a vulnerable command line:\n`vim -e -s -S {malicious_file}`\n\nOpening files with vim in this specific mode is highly unlikely.\n\nThis vulnerability has no security impact at all since if an attacker can run arbitrary vim commands, then the attacker can also execute arbitrary shell commands using the exclamation mark, and does not need this vulnerability to achieve code execution.

            "FullDescription": "[Vim](https://www.vim.org/) is a free, open-source, screen-based text editor program for Unix.\nVim has an `Ex mode` that allows entering Ex commands and is designed for Batch processing.\n\nThe Ex, or colon, commands are based on the line editor named ex. In general, they operate on the document as a whole, or large portions of it (although there are commands to perform essentially every editing task).\n\nIt was discovered that when sourcing a file using Vim `Ex mode`, a use-after-free may occur, which leads to a denial of service.\n\n`vim` can be run with one or more flags. These flags include, but are not limited to:\n\n* `-e`: With the `-e` flag, the user enters Ex mode. The Ex mode is similar to the command line mode as it also allows you to enter Ex commands.\n* `-s`: With the `-s` flag, the user can silence the ex mode, to support batch commands.\n* `-S`: With the `-S` flag, the user sources the file after loading it.\n\nThe issue requires the victim to run an attacker's specially crafted file in `Ex mode` and source it as well.\nAn example of a vulnerable command line:\n`vim -e -s -S {malicious_file}`\n\nOpening files with vim in this specific mode is highly unlikely.\n\nThis vulnerability has no security impact at all since if an attacker can run arbitrary vim commands, then the attacker can also execute arbitrary shell commands using the exclamation mark, and does not need this vulnerability to achieve code execution. For example running the vim command `!ls` will execute the shell command `ls`.",

In general, they operate on the document as a whole, or large portions of it (although there are commands to perform essentially every editing task).\n\nIt was discovered that when sourcing a file using Vim `Ex mode`, a heap overflow may occur, which leads to a denial of service.\n\n`vim` can be run with one or more flags. These flags include, but are not limited to:\n\n* `-e`: With the `-e` flag, the user enters Ex mode. The Ex mode is similar to the command line mode as it also allows you to enter Ex commands.\n* `-s`: With the `-s` flag, the user can silence the ex mode, to support batch commands.\n* `-S`: With the `-S` flag, the user sources the file after loading it.\n\nThe issue requires the victim to run an attacker's specially crafted file in `Ex mode` and source it as well.\nAn example of a vulnerable command line:\n`vim -e -s -S {malicious_file}`\n\nOpening files with vim in this specific mode is highly unlikely.\n\nThis vulnerability has no security impact at all since if an attacker can run arbitrary vim commands, then the attacker can also execute arbitrary shell commands using the exclamation mark, and does not need this vulnerability to achieve code execution.

            "ShortDescription": "(Non-Issue) Buffer overflow in vim leads to denial of service and potentially code execution when running crafted vim commands.",
            "FullDescription": "[Vim](https://www.vim.org/) is a free, open-source, screen-based text editor program for Unix.\nVim has an `Ex mode` that allows entering Ex commands and is designed for Batch processing.\n\nThe Ex, or colon, commands are based on the line editor named ex. In general, they operate on the document as a whole, or large portions of it (although there are commands to perform essentially every editing task).\n\nIt was discovered that when sourcing a file using Vim `Ex mode`, a heap overflow may occur, which leads to a denial of service.\n\n`vim` can be run with one or more flags. These flags include, but are not limited to:\n\n* `-e`: With the `-e` flag, the user enters Ex mode. The Ex mode is similar to the command line mode as it also allows you to enter Ex commands.\n* `-s`: With the `-s` flag, the user can silence the ex mode, to support batch commands.\n* `-S`: With the `-S` flag, the user sources the file after loading it.\n\nThe issue requires the victim to run an attacker's specially crafted file in `Ex mode` and source it as well.\nAn example of a vulnerable command line:\n`vim -e -s -S {malicious_file}`\n\nOpening files with vim in this specific mode is highly unlikely.\n\nThis vulnerability has no security impact at all since if an attacker can run arbitrary vim commands, then the attacker can also execute arbitrary shell commands using the exclamation mark, and does not need this vulnerability to achieve code execution. For example running the vim command `!ls` will execute the shell command `ls`.",

By default, it does not verify TLS certificates. To enable it, the `verify_SSL=>1` flag should be specified when initializing the `HTTP::Tiny` object. The problem identified in `HTTP::Tiny` has been assigned the CVE identifier `CVE-2023-31486` and serves as the underlying cause for the problem in `CPAN.pm`.\n\n`CPAN.pm` downloads and executes code through the `install` command followed by the package name.\nAlthough `CPAN.pm` downloads from `https://cpan.org`, it does not enable TLS certificate verification while using `HTTP::Tiny`, which could potentially allow an attacker to perform a man-in-the-middle attack by injecting malicious data that could be executed by CPAN.pm.\n\nExample of a vulnerable code:\n```\nuse CPAN;\ninstall DateTime\n```\n\nExample of a vulnerable command-line:\n```\ncpan install DateTime\n```",

            "FullDescription": "The `urllib` package in Python is a built-in module that provides a set of functions for working with URLs (Uniform Resource Locators). It offers capabilities for making HTTP requests, handling URL encodings, parsing URLs, and other common tasks related to web interactions.\n\nThe `urllib.parse` module, part of the `urllib` package in Python, provides functions for parsing and manipulating URLs. It offers utilities for URL encoding and decoding, splitting URLs into components, constructing URLs from components, and other URL-related operations.\n\nThe `urlparse()` or `urlsplit()` functions have been found to have a flaw during URL processing. This vulnerability allows an attacker to pass an invalid URL that contains newlines and tabs without undergoing proper sanitation.\nThis violates the URL Specification, which mandates the removal of all newlines and tabs from a URL prior to processing.\n\nThe issue could cause any blacklisting methods based on the parsed URL to fail.\n\nAn example where the URL path is not parsed correctly -\n```py\nfrom urllib.parse import urlsplit\n\nsplitresult = urlsplit(\"fi\\nle://127.0.0.1/etc/passwd\")\nprint(splitresult)\n```\n\nThe result would be:\n```\nSplitResult(scheme='', netloc='', path=\"fi\\nle://127.0.0.1/etc/passwd\", query='', fragment='')\n```",

            "FullDescription": "[Python](https://www.python.org/) is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility.\nThe Python standard library is a collection of modules and packages that are part of the Python distribution by default and provides a wide range of functionality for common tasks, such as working with data structures, file I/O, networking, and more.\nIDNA (Internationalized Domain Names in Applications) encoding and decoding is part of Python's standard library, specifically the `encodings.idna` module, which provides functions to convert domain names between their ASCII and Unicode forms according to the IDNA specification.\n\nWhen processing certain domain names as input, the `idna.decode()` function could cause excessive CPU consumption and result in a DoS. Since hostnames are often supplied by remote servers that could be controlled by an attacker, the vulnerability could be exploited by triggering the CPU consumption on a client attempting to process a crafted, unreasonably long name.\n\nNote that according to IDNA specifications, the IDNA label names cannot be more than 63 ASCII characters. However, Python's `idna` module does not enforce this restriction.\n\nVulnerable code snippet #1 -\n```python\nimport idna\nidna.decode(external_input)\n```\n\nVulnerable code snippet #2 -\n```python\nexternal_input_bytes.decode('idna')\n```\n\nNote that some Python 3rd-party libraries, such as [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) may be vulnerable to this issue remotely. For example, the `urllib.request.HTTPRedirectHandler` class passes the `Location` response header to the idna module directly, when parsing an HTTP 302 redirect response.",

It creates and listens at the HTTP socket, dispatching the requests to a handler. A flaw in the [`URI path`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier#Syntax) validation, causing [open redirection](https://brightsec.com/blog/open-redirect-vulnerabilities/), can lead to data leakage.\n\nExample:\n```\nhttp://127.0.0.1:8000//attacker.com/..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f../%0a%0d/../.ssh\n```\nThe multiple `/` is interpreted as a domain name. The last one will be processed as the good one. Here, `attacker.com` is considered as the domain and so it will set the `Location` parameter of the response to this value. Thus, it will redirect the client to the `attacker.com` domain. \n\nThis CVE was disputed, as the `http.server` module is not made for production but only for test purposes, as mentioned in the documentation.",

            "FullDescription": "[Python](https://www.python.org/) is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility.\nThe Python standard library is a collection of modules and packages that are part of the Python distribution by default and provides a wide range of functionality for common tasks, such as working with data structures, file I/O, networking, and more.\nIDNA (Internationalized Domain Names in Applications) encoding and decoding is part of Python's standard library, specifically the `encodings.idna` module, which provides functions to convert domain names between their ASCII and Unicode forms according to the IDNA specification.\n\nWhen processing certain domain names as input, the `idna.decode()` function could cause excessive CPU consumption and result in a DoS. Since hostnames are often supplied by remote servers that could be controlled by an attacker, the vulnerability could be exploited by triggering the CPU consumption on a client attempting to process a crafted, unreasonably long name.\n\nNote that according to IDNA specifications, the IDNA label names cannot be more than 63 ASCII characters. However, Python's `idna` module does not enforce this restriction.\n\nVulnerable code snippet #1 -\n```python\nimport idna\nidna.decode(external_input)\n```\n\nVulnerable code snippet #2 -\n```python\nexternal_input_bytes.decode('idna')\n```\n\nNote that some Python 3rd-party libraries, such as [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) may be vulnerable to this issue remotely. For example, the `urllib.request.HTTPRedirectHandler` class passes the `Location` response header to the idna module directly, when parsing an HTTP 302 redirect response.",

Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained\nfrom an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service.\n\nThe function DH_check() performs various checks on DH parameters. After fixing\nCVE-2023-3446 it was discovered that a large q parameter value can also trigger\nan overly long computation during some of these checks. A correct q value,\nif present, cannot be larger than the modulus p parameter, thus it is\nunnecessary to perform these checks if q is larger than p.\n\nAn application that calls DH_check() and supplies a key or parameters obtained\nfrom an untrusted source could be vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack.\n\nThe function DH_check() is itself called by a number of other OpenSSL functions.\nAn application calling any of those other functions may similarly be affected.\nThe other functions affected by this are DH_check_ex() and\nEVP_PKEY_param_check().\n\nAlso vulnerable are the OpenSSL dhparam and pkeyparam command line applications\nwhen using the \"-check\" option.\n\nThe OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.\n\nThe OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are not affected by this issue.",

The desired FTP user and password are set by the following options, which are not vulnerable to this issue (using different values for these options will invalidate cached connections) -\n* CURLOPT_USERNAME\n* CURLOPT_PASSWORD\n* CURLOPT_USERPWD",

            "ShortDescription": "Connection reuse in curl may lead to authentication bypass when changing GSS delegation between requests.",
            "FullDescription": "[Curl](https://curl.se/) is a command-line tool for transferring data from or to a server, using various protocols like HTTP, FTP, SMTP, and more.\nGSS-API delegation is a mechanism where a server can obtain credentials from a client and use them to access resources on behalf of the client. This allows the server to act as a proxy for the client, using the client's credentials to access resources that the client may not have direct access to.\n\nTo delegate credentials, the client establishes a GSS-API security context with the server, and if the client supports delegation and has valid credentials, sends a \"forwardable\" ticket to the server. The server can then use this ticket to access resources on behalf of the client. \n\nlibcurl can reuse a previously created connection even when the delegation option had been changed which could have made the effective user no longer have access, thus leading to doing the second transfer with the wrong permissions.\n\nSpecifically, connecting to the same server while changing the following setting - `CURLOPT_GSSAPI_DELEGATION` (or `--delegation` in curl command line) will erroneously re-use a previously cached connection (if the previous connection has been made from the same process), which is unexpected.\n\nGSS-API delegation can also be used with Kerberos. When using Kerberos with GSS-API delegation, the client obtains a Kerberos ticket-granting ticket (TGT) during authentication, which can be used by the server to obtain a service ticket for accessing resources on behalf of the client. The server can then use the service ticket to access resources on the client's behalf without requiring the client to re-authenticate.\n\nIt is highly unlikely that a user would suddenly no longer have access because of a change in delegation in the second request.",

This allows the server to act as a proxy for the client, using the client's credentials to access resources that the client may not have direct access to.\n\nTo delegate credentials, the client establishes a GSS-API security context with the server, and if the client supports delegation and has valid credentials, sends a \"forwardable\" ticket to the server. The server can then use this ticket to access resources on behalf of the client. \n\nlibcurl can reuse a previously created connection even when the delegation option had been changed which could have made the effective user no longer have access, thus leading to doing the second transfer with the wrong permissions.\n\nSpecifically, connecting to the same server while changing the following setting - `CURLOPT_GSSAPI_DELEGATION` (or `--delegation` in curl command line) will erroneously re-use a previously cached connection (if the previous connection has been made from the same process), which is unexpected.\n\nGSS-API delegation can also be used with Kerberos. When using Kerberos with GSS-API delegation, the client obtains a Kerberos ticket-granting ticket (TGT) during authentication, which can be used by the server to obtain a service ticket for accessing resources on behalf of the client. The server can then use the service ticket to access resources on the client's behalf without requiring the client to re-authenticate.\n\nIt is highly unlikely that a user would suddenly no longer have access because of a change in delegation in the second request.",

This data will not be authenticated if the server-side TLS peer is expecting client certificate authentication, and is indistinguishable from valid TLS stream data. Data is limited in size to the amount that will fit in the buffer. (The TLS connection cannot directly be used for data exfiltration because the vulnerable code path requires that the connection be closed on initialization of the SSLSocket.)",

            "ShortDescription": "(Non-Issue) Use-after-free in vim leads to denial of service and potentially code execution when running crafted vim commands.",
            "FullDescription": "[Vim](https://www.vim.org/) is a free, open-source, screen-based text editor program for Unix.\nVim has an `Ex mode` that allows entering Ex commands and is designed for Batch processing.\n\nThe Ex, or colon, commands are based on the line editor named ex. In general, they operate on the document as a whole, or large portions of it (although there are commands to perform essentially every editing task).\n\nIt was discovered that when sourcing a file using Vim `Ex mode`, a use-after-free may occur, which leads to a denial of service.\n\n`vim` can be run with one or more flags. These flags include, but are not limited to:\n\n* `-e`: With the `-e` flag, the user enters Ex mode. The Ex mode is similar to the command line mode as it also allows you to enter Ex commands.\n* `-s`: With the `-s` flag, the user can silence the ex mode, to support batch commands.\n* `-S`: With the `-S` flag, the user sources the file after loading it.\n\nThe issue requires the victim to run an attacker's specially crafted file in `Ex mode` and source it as well.\nAn example of a vulnerable command line:\n`vim -e -s -S {malicious_file}`\n\nOpening files with vim in this specific mode is highly unlikely.\n\nThis vulnerability has no security impact at all since if an attacker can run arbitrary vim commands, then the attacker can also execute arbitrary shell commands using the exclamation mark, and does not need this vulnerability to achieve code execution. For example running the vim command `!ls` will execute the shell command `ls`.",

            "FullDescription": "[Vim](https://www.vim.org/) is a free, open-source, screen-based text editor program for Unix.\nVim has an `Ex mode` that allows entering Ex commands and is designed for Batch processing.\n\nThe Ex, or colon, commands are based on the line editor named ex. In general, they operate on the document as a whole, or large portions of it (although there are commands to perform essentially every editing task).\n\nIt was discovered that when sourcing a file using Vim `Ex mode`, a use-after-free may occur, which leads to a denial of service.\n\n`vim` can be run with one or more flags. These flags include, but are not limited to:\n\n* `-e`: With the `-e` flag, the user enters Ex mode. The Ex mode is similar to the command line mode as it also allows you to enter Ex commands.\n* `-s`: With the `-s` flag, the user can silence the ex mode, to support batch commands.\n* `-S`: With the `-S` flag, the user sources the file after loading it.\n\nThe issue requires the victim to run an attacker's specially crafted file in `Ex mode` and source it as well.\nAn example of a vulnerable command line:\n`vim -e -s -S {malicious_file}`\n\nOpening files with vim in this specific mode is highly unlikely.\n\nThis vulnerability has no security impact at all since if an attacker can run arbitrary vim commands, then the attacker can also execute arbitrary shell commands using the exclamation mark, and does not need this vulnerability to achieve code execution. For example running the vim command `!ls` will execute the shell command `ls`.",

            "ShortDescription": "(Non-Issue) Buffer overflow in vim leads to denial of service and potentially code execution when running crafted vim commands.",
            "FullDescription": "[Vim](https://www.vim.org/) is a free, open-source, screen-based text editor program for Unix.\nVim has an `Ex mode` that allows entering Ex commands and is designed for Batch processing.\n\nThe Ex, or colon, commands are based on the line editor named ex. In general, they operate on the document as a whole, or large portions of it (although there are commands to perform essentially every editing task).\n\nIt was discovered that when sourcing a file using Vim `Ex mode`, a heap overflow may occur, which leads to a denial of service.\n\n`vim` can be run with one or more flags. These flags include, but are not limited to:\n\n* `-e`: With the `-e` flag, the user enters Ex mode. The Ex mode is similar to the command line mode as it also allows you to enter Ex commands.\n* `-s`: With the `-s` flag, the user can silence the ex mode, to support batch commands.\n* `-S`: With the `-S` flag, the user sources the file after loading it.\n\nThe issue requires the victim to run an attacker's specially crafted file in `Ex mode` and source it as well.\nAn example of a vulnerable command line:\n`vim -e -s -S {malicious_file}`\n\nOpening files with vim in this specific mode is highly unlikely.\n\nThis vulnerability has no security impact at all since if an attacker can run arbitrary vim commands, then the attacker can also execute arbitrary shell commands using the exclamation mark, and does not need this vulnerability to achieve code execution. For example running the vim command `!ls` will execute the shell command `ls`.",

            "FullDescription": "[Vim](https://www.vim.org/) is a free, open-source, screen-based text editor program for Unix.\nVim has an `Ex mode` that allows entering Ex commands and is designed for Batch processing.\n\nThe Ex, or colon, commands are based on the line editor named ex. In general, they operate on the document as a whole, or large portions of it (although there are commands to perform essentially every editing task).\n\nIt was discovered that when sourcing a file using Vim `Ex mode`, a heap overflow may occur, which leads to a denial of service.\n\n`vim` can be run with one or more flags. These flags include, but are not limited to:\n\n* `-e`: With the `-e` flag, the user enters Ex mode. The Ex mode is similar to the command line mode as it also allows you to enter Ex commands.\n* `-s`: With the `-s` flag, the user can silence the ex mode, to support batch commands.\n* `-S`: With the `-S` flag, the user sources the file after loading it.\n\nThe issue requires the victim to run an attacker's specially crafted file in `Ex mode` and source it as well.\nAn example of a vulnerable command line:\n`vim -e -s -S {malicious_file}`\n\nOpening files with vim in this specific mode is highly unlikely.\n\nThis vulnerability has no security impact at all since if an attacker can run arbitrary vim commands, then the attacker can also execute arbitrary shell commands using the exclamation mark, and does not need this vulnerability to achieve code execution. For example running the vim command `!ls` will execute the shell command `ls`.",

In general, they operate on the document as a whole, or large portions of it (although there are commands to perform essentially every editing task).\n\nIt was discovered that when sourcing a file using Vim `Ex mode`, a heap overflow may occur, which leads to a denial of service.\n\n`vim` can be run with one or more flags. These flags include, but are not limited to:\n\n* `-e`: With the `-e` flag, the user enters Ex mode. The Ex mode is similar to the command line mode as it also allows you to enter Ex commands.\n* `-s`: With the `-s` flag, the user can silence the ex mode, to support batch commands.\n* `-S`: With the `-S` flag, the user sources the file after loading it.\n\nThe issue requires the victim to run an attacker's specially crafted file in `Ex mode` and source it as well.\nAn example of a vulnerable command line:\n`vim -e -s -S {malicious_file}`\n\nOpening files with vim in this specific mode is highly unlikely.\n\nThis vulnerability has no security impact at all since if an attacker can run arbitrary vim commands, then the attacker can also execute arbitrary shell commands using the exclamation mark, and does not need this vulnerability to achieve code execution. For example running the vim command `!ls` will execute the shell command `ls`.",

            "ShortDescription": "A design problem in the implementation of the HTTP/2 protocol may lead to DoS and ease the possibility of DDoS in web server applications by abusing request cancellation.",
            "FullDescription": "[The HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP) is a fundamental protocol of the World Wide Web, enabling the exchange of data between a client (typically a web browser) and a server. It defines the rules for requesting and transmitting web pages and other resources over the internet. Request and response messages are exchanged as a stream of ASCII characters, sent over a reliable transport layer like TCP.\n\n[HTTP/2](https://http2.github.io/) is a modern network protocol designed to improve the performance and efficiency of web communication. It replaces the older HTTP/1.1 protocol and introduces features like header compression and enhanced request cancellation mechanisms, which collectively enhance the speed and responsiveness of websites.\n\nThis request cancellation mechanism allows clients to terminate unnecessary or redundant requests without waiting for a server's response, reducing network congestion and further improving the overall responsiveness of web applications.\n\nHTTP/2 resolves numerous concerns found in HTTP/1.1 by organizing each HTTP message into a series of HTTP/2 frames. These frames include type, length, flags, stream identifier (ID), and payload. The stream ID is essential in clearly associating specific bytes on the network with their corresponding messages, facilitating secure multiplexing and concurrent processing. These streams are bidirectional, enabling clients to transmit frames, and servers to respond with frames using the same ID.\n\nAs detailed in [this technical analysis](https://blog.cloudflare.com/technical-breakdown-http2-rapid-reset-ddos-attack/), there's a vulnerability in the way request cancellation is implemented. The flaw lies in the process of sending an excessive number of requests (specifically, `HEADERS` frames), each immediately followed by a request cancellation frame utilizing the `RST_STREAM` frame. This sequence rapidly leads to a substantial consumption of server-side resources. Consequently, this vulnerability amplifies the risk of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, making it easier to overwhelm and exhaust the server's available resources.\n\nA lot of server applications are vulnerable to the Http/2 Rapid Reset attack.\nHowever, note that HTTP/2 must be enabled, which is not the default configuration on most applications (excluding nghttp2 for example).\nA non-exhaustive list of these vulnerable web applications:\n```\n- Tomcat\n- Jetty\n- NGINX on certain conditions\n- nghttp2\n- Netty\n```",
            "Impact": 6,
            "VulnerabilityType": "Denial of service",
            "Resolution": "##### Development mitigations\n\nFor netty:\n```java\nimport io.netty.handler.codec.http2.Http2FrameListener;\nimport io.netty.handler.codec.http2.Http2FrameStream;\nimport io.netty.handler.codec.http2.Http2ResetFrame;\nimport io.netty.handler.codec.http2.Http2HeadersFrame;\n\npublic class CustomHttp2FrameListener implements Http2FrameListener {\n    private int rstFrameCount = 0;\n    private int maxRstFrameCount = 10; // Adjust this to your desired limit\n    private long resetTimeMillis = System.currentTimeMillis();\n    private long resetTimeIntervalMillis = 60000; // 60 seconds\n\n    @Override\n    public int onDataRead(Http2FrameStream stream, byte[] data, int padding, boolean endOfStream) {\n        // Handle data frames if needed\n        return 0;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void onHeadersRead(Http2FrameStream stream, Http2HeadersFrame headersFrame) {\n        // Handle headers frames if needed\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void onHeadersRead(Http2FrameStream stream, Http2HeadersFrame headersFrame, boolean endOfStream) {\n        // Handle headers frames if needed\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void onRstStreamRead(Http2FrameStream stream, Http2ResetFrame resetFrame) {\n        long currentTimeMillis = System.currentTimeMillis();\n        \n        // Check if the reset time interval has passed, and reset the count if needed\n        if (currentTimeMillis - resetTimeMillis >= resetTimeIntervalMillis) {\n            rstFrameCount = 0;\n            resetTimeMillis = currentTimeMillis;\n        }\n        \n        rstFrameCount++;\n        \n        // Check if the count exceeds the limit\n        if (rstFrameCount > maxRstFrameCount) {\n            // Take action, e.g., close the connection, log, or drop frames\n            // You can use stream or resetFrame to get more context if needed.\n            // To close the connection, you can use stream.connection().close();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n##### Development mitigations\n\nFor Golang:\n\nThe default stream concurrency limit in `golang` is `250 streams (requests) per HTTP/2 connection`. This value may be adjusted in the `golang.org/x/net/http2` package using the `Server.MaxConcurrentStreams` setting and the `ConfigureServer` function which are available in `golang.org/x/net/http2`.\n\n```go\nimport (\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"golang.org/x/net/http2\"\n\t\"net/http\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\t// Create an HTTP/2 server instance\n\thttp2Server := &http2.Server{}\n\n\t// Set the desired stream concurrency limit\n\tmaxConcurrentStreams := 500 // Change this to your desired limit\n\thttp2Server.MaxConcurrentStreams = uint32(maxConcurrentStreams)\n\n\t// Configure an HTTP server to use HTTP/2 with the adjusted settings\n\tserver := &http.Server{\n\t\tAddr:    \":8080\",\n\t\tHandler: http.HandlerFunc(handleRequest),\n\t}\n\thttp2.ConfigureServer(server, http2Server)\n\n\t// Start the HTTP server\n\terr := server.ListenAndServeTLS(\"cert.pem\", \"key.pem\")\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tfmt.Println(\"Error:\", err)\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n##### Development mitigations\n\nFor Nghttp2:\nImplement `nghttp2_on_frame_recv_callback` callback function, and check and count `RST_STREAM` frames. If an excessive number of `RST_STREAM` frames are received, then take action, such as dropping the connection silently, or calling `nghttp2_submit_goaway` and gracefully terminate the connection.\n```c\n#include <nghttp2/nghttp2.h>\n\n// Callback function for handling frame reception\nint on_frame_recv_callback(nghttp2_session* session,\n                           const nghttp2_frame* frame, void* user_data) {\n    // Check if the received frame is an RST_STREAM frame\n    if (frame->hd.type == NGHTTP2_RST_STREAM) {\n        // Increment a counter for RST_STREAM frames\n        int* rst_stream_counter = (int*)user_data;\n        (*rst_stream_counter)++;\n        \n        // Define a threshold for excessive RST_STREAM frames\n        int rst_stream_threshold = 10;  // Adjust this value as needed\n        \n        // If the threshold is exceeded, take action (e.g., close the connection)\n        if (*rst_stream_counter > rst_stream_threshold) {\n            // Here, you can choose to close the connection gracefully or drop it\n            // For demonstration purposes, we'll just print a message\n            printf(\"Excessive RST_STREAM frames received. Closing the connection.\\n\");\n            // You can call nghttp2_submit_goaway() to send a GOAWAY frame if needed.\n            // nghttp2_submit_goaway(session, NGHTTP2_FLAG_NONE, error_code, opaque_data);\n            // Then, close the connection.\n        }\n    }\n    \n    // Continue processing other frames if needed\n    return 0;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    // Initialize nghttp2_session and set up the on_frame_recv_callback\n    nghttp2_session* session;\n    int rst_stream_counter = 0;\n    \n    // Initialize nghttp2_session, set up callbacks, etc.\n    // ...\n\n    // Set the user data to be passed to the callback\n    nghttp2_session_user_data(session, &rst_stream_counter);\n    \n    // Register the on_frame_recv_callback\n    nghttp2_session_callbacks* callbacks;\n    nghttp2_session_callbacks_new(&callbacks);\n    nghttp2_session_callbacks_set_on_frame_recv_callback(callbacks, on_frame_recv_callback);\n    // Other callback registrations here...\n    \n    // Attach the callbacks to the session\n    nghttp2_session_server_new(&session, callbacks, &rst_stream_counter);\n    \n    // Start processing HTTP/2 frames\n    // ...\n\n    // Cleanup and finish the program\n    // ...\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n##### Deployment mitigations\n\nFor NGINX:\n\nDisabling HTTP/2 in NGINX is not necessary. Simply ensure you have configured:\n\n- `keepalive_requests` should be kept at the default setting of 1000 requests\n- `http2_max_concurrent_streams` should be kept at the default setting of 128 streams\n- `limit_conn` and `limit_req` should be set \"with a reasonable setting balancing application performance and security\"\n\n##### Deployment mitigations\n\nA possible mitigation is to limit the maximum number of requests that can be made over a single keep-alive connection.",

In general, they operate on the document as a whole, or large portions of it (although there are commands to perform essentially every editing task).\n\nIt was discovered that when sourcing a file using Vim `Ex mode`, a heap overflow may occur, which leads to a denial of service.\n\n`vim` can be run with one or more flags. These flags include, but are not limited to:\n\n* `-e`: With the `-e` flag, the user enters Ex mode. The Ex mode is similar to the command line mode as it also allows you to enter Ex commands.\n* `-s`: With the `-s` flag, the user can silence the ex mode, to support batch commands.\n* `-S`: With the `-S` flag, the user sources the file after loading it.\n\nThe issue requires the victim to run an attacker's specially crafted file in `Ex mode` and source it as well.\nAn example of a vulnerable command line:\n`vim -e -s -S {malicious_file}`\n\nOpening files with vim in this specific mode is highly unlikely.\n\nThis vulnerability has no security impact at all since if an attacker can run arbitrary vim commands, then the attacker can also execute arbitrary shell commands using the exclamation mark, and does not need this vulnerability to achieve code execution. For example running the vim command `!ls` will execute the shell command `ls`.",

            "FullDescription": "[Vim](https://www.vim.org/) is a free, open-source, screen-based text editor program for Unix.\nVim has an `Ex mode` that allows entering Ex commands and is designed for Batch processing.\n\nThe Ex, or colon, commands are based on the line editor named ex. In general, they operate on the document as a whole, or large portions of it (although there are commands to perform essentially every editing task).\n\nIt was discovered that when sourcing a file using Vim `Ex mode`, a heap overflow may occur, which leads to a denial of service.\n\n`vim` can be run with one or more flags. These flags include, but are not limited to:\n\n* `-e`: With the `-e` flag, the user enters Ex mode. The Ex mode is similar to the command line mode as it also allows you to enter Ex commands.\n* `-s`: With the `-s` flag, the user can silence the ex mode, to support batch commands.\n* `-S`: With the `-S` flag, the user sources the file after loading it.\n\nThe issue requires the victim to run an attacker's specially crafted file in `Ex mode` and source it as well.\nAn example of a vulnerable command line:\n`vim -e -s -S {malicious_file}`\n\nOpening files with vim in this specific mode is highly unlikely.\n\nThis vulnerability has no security impact at all since if an attacker can run arbitrary vim commands, then the attacker can also execute arbitrary shell commands using the exclamation mark, and does not need this vulnerability to achieve code execution. For example running the vim command `!ls` will execute the shell command `ls`.",

In general, they operate on the document as a whole, or large portions of it (although there are commands to perform essentially every editing task).\n\nIt was discovered that when sourcing a file using Vim `Ex mode`, a divide-by-zero error may occur, which leads to a denial of service.\n\n`vim` can be run with one or more flags. These flags include, but are not limited to:\n\n* `-e`: With the `-e` flag, the user enters Ex mode. The Ex mode is similar to the command line mode as it also allows you to enter Ex commands.\n* `-s`: With the `-s` flag, the user can silence the ex mode, to support batch commands.\n* `-S`: With the `-S` flag, the user sources the file after loading it.\n\nThe issue requires the victim to run an attacker's specially crafted file in `Ex mode` and source it as well.\nAn example of a vulnerable command line:\n`vim -e -s -S {malicious_file}`\n\nOpening files with vim in this specific mode is highly unlikely.\n\nThis vulnerability has no security impact at all since if an attacker can run arbitrary vim commands, then the attacker can also execute arbitrary shell commands using the exclamation mark, and does not need this vulnerability to achieve code execution.

            "ShortDescription": "(Non-Issue) Use-after-free in vim leads to denial of service and potentially code execution when running crafted vim commands.",
            "FullDescription": "[Vim](https://www.vim.org/) is a free, open-source, screen-based text editor program for Unix.\nVim has an `Ex mode` that allows entering Ex commands and is designed for Batch processing.\n\nThe Ex, or colon, commands are based on the line editor named ex. In general, they operate on the document as a whole, or large portions of it (although there are commands to perform essentially every editing task).\n\nIt was discovered that when sourcing a file using Vim `Ex mode`, a use-after-free may occur, which leads to a denial of service.\n\n`vim` can be run with one or more flags. These flags include, but are not limited to:\n\n* `-e`: With the `-e` flag, the user enters Ex mode. The Ex mode is similar to the command line mode as it also allows you to enter Ex commands.\n* `-s`: With the `-s` flag, the user can silence the ex mode, to support batch commands.\n* `-S`: With the `-S` flag, the user sources the file after loading it.\n\nThe issue requires the victim to run an attacker's specially crafted file in `Ex mode` and source it as well.\nAn example of a vulnerable command line:\n`vim -e -s -S {malicious_file}`\n\nOpening files with vim in this specific mode is highly unlikely.\n\nThis vulnerability has no security impact at all since if an attacker can run arbitrary vim commands, then the attacker can also execute arbitrary shell commands using the exclamation mark, and does not need this vulnerability to achieve code execution. For example running the vim command `!ls` will execute the shell command `ls`.",

Parsing incomplete numbers with no proper error handling can lead to denial of service. \n\nAlthough no public exploit is currently known for this vulnerability, attackers can find a remote input that propagates to one of the vulnerable functions and exploit this vulnerability.

Parsing incomplete numbers with no proper error handling can lead to denial of service. \n\nAlthough no public exploit is currently known for this vulnerability, attackers can find a remote input that propagates to one of the vulnerable functions and exploit this vulnerability. Attackers can simply exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted proto message containing an incomplete negative number to cause a denial of service.",

            "ShortDescription": "(Non-Issue) Buffer overflow in vim leads to denial of service and potentially code execution when running crafted vim commands.",
            "FullDescription": "[Vim](https://www.vim.org/) is a free, open-source, screen-based text editor program for Unix.\nVim has an `Ex mode` that allows entering Ex commands and is designed for Batch processing.\n\nThe Ex, or colon, commands are based on the line editor named ex. In general, they operate on the document as a whole, or large portions of it (although there are commands to perform essentially every editing task).\n\nIt was discovered that when sourcing a file using Vim `Ex mode`, a heap overflow may occur, which leads to a denial of service.\n\n`vim` can be run with one or more flags. These flags include, but are not limited to:\n\n* `-e`: With the `-e` flag, the user enters Ex mode. The Ex mode is similar to the command line mode as it also allows you to enter Ex commands.\n* `-s`: With the `-s` flag, the user can silence the ex mode, to support batch commands.\n* `-S`: With the `-S` flag, the user sources the file after loading it.\n\nThe issue requires the victim to run an attacker's specially crafted file in `Ex mode` and source it as well.\nAn example of a vulnerable command line:\n`vim -e -s -S {malicious_file}`\n\nOpening files with vim in this specific mode is highly unlikely.\n\nThis vulnerability has no security impact at all since if an attacker can run arbitrary vim commands, then the attacker can also execute arbitrary shell commands using the exclamation mark, and does not need this vulnerability to achieve code execution. For example running the vim command `!ls` will execute the shell command `ls`.",

            "FullDescription": "[Vim](https://www.vim.org/) is a free, open-source, screen-based text editor program for Unix.\nVim has an `Ex mode` that allows entering Ex commands and is designed for Batch processing.\n\nThe Ex, or colon, commands are based on the line editor named ex. In general, they operate on the document as a whole, or large portions of it (although there are commands to perform essentially every editing task).\n\nIt was discovered that when sourcing a file using Vim `Ex mode`, a heap overflow may occur, which leads to a denial of service.\n\n`vim` can be run with one or more flags. These flags include, but are not limited to:\n\n* `-e`: With the `-e` flag, the user enters Ex mode. The Ex mode is similar to the command line mode as it also allows you to enter Ex commands.\n* `-s`: With the `-s` flag, the user can silence the ex mode, to support batch commands.\n* `-S`: With the `-S` flag, the user sources the file after loading it.\n\nThe issue requires the victim to run an attacker's specially crafted file in `Ex mode` and source it as well.\nAn example of a vulnerable command line:\n`vim -e -s -S {malicious_file}`\n\nOpening files with vim in this specific mode is highly unlikely.\n\nThis vulnerability has no security impact at all since if an attacker can run arbitrary vim commands, then the attacker can also execute arbitrary shell commands using the exclamation mark, and does not need this vulnerability to achieve code execution. For example running the vim command `!ls` will execute the shell command `ls`.",

            "FullDescription": "[Vim](https://www.vim.org/) is a free, open-source, screen-based text editor program for Unix.\nVim has an `Ex mode` that allows entering Ex commands and is designed for Batch processing.\n\nThe Ex, or colon, commands are based on the line editor named ex. In general, they operate on the document as a whole, or large portions of it (although there are commands to perform essentially every editing task).\n\nIt was discovered that when sourcing a file using Vim `Ex mode`, a heap overflow may occur, which leads to a denial of service.\n\n`vim` can be run with one or more flags. These flags include, but are not limited to:\n\n* `-e`: With the `-e` flag, the user enters Ex mode. The Ex mode is similar to the command line mode as it also allows you to enter Ex commands.\n* `-s`: With the `-s` flag, the user can silence the ex mode, to support batch commands.\n* `-S`: With the `-S` flag, the user sources the file after loading it.\n\nThe issue requires the victim to run an attacker's specially crafted file in `Ex mode` and source it as well.\nAn example of a vulnerable command line:\n`vim -e -s -S {malicious_file}`\n\nOpening files with vim in this specific mode is highly unlikely.\n\nThis vulnerability has no security impact at all since if an attacker can run arbitrary vim commands, then the attacker can also execute arbitrary shell commands using the exclamation mark, and does not need this vulnerability to achieve code execution. For example running the vim command `!ls` will execute the shell command `ls`.",

            "FullDescription": "[Vim](https://www.vim.org/) is a free, open-source, screen-based text editor program for Unix.\nVim has an `Ex mode` that allows entering Ex commands and is designed for Batch processing.\n\nThe Ex, or colon, commands are based on the line editor named ex. In general, they operate on the document as a whole, or large portions of it (although there are commands to perform essentially every editing task).\n\nIt was discovered that when sourcing a file using Vim `Ex mode`, a heap overflow may occur, which leads to a denial of service.\n\n`vim` can be run with one or more flags. These flags include, but are not limited to:\n\n* `-e`: With the `-e` flag, the user enters Ex mode. The Ex mode is similar to the command line mode as it also allows you to enter Ex commands.\n* `-s`: With the `-s` flag, the user can silence the ex mode, to support batch commands.\n* `-S`: With the `-S` flag, the user sources the file after loading it.\n\nThe issue requires the victim to run an attacker's specially crafted file in `Ex mode` and source it as well.\nAn example of a vulnerable command line:\n`vim -e -s -S {malicious_file}`\n\nOpening files with vim in this specific mode is highly unlikely.\n\nThis vulnerability has no security impact at all since if an attacker can run arbitrary vim commands, then the attacker can also execute arbitrary shell commands using the exclamation mark, and does not need this vulnerability to achieve code execution. For example running the vim command `!ls` will execute the shell command `ls`.",

            "FullDescription": "[curl](https://curl.se) is a command line tool and a library for transferring data, supporting various network protocols. \n\n[HTTP Strict Transport Security](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/HTTP_strict_transport_security) (HSTS) is a simple and widely supported standard to protect visitors by ensuring that their browsers always connect to a website over HTTPS. HSTS exists to remove the need for the common, insecure practice of redirecting users from `http://` to `https://` URLs.\n\n[Internationalized Domain Names](https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215864977-Internationalized-domain-names-IDNs-) (IDNs) are domain names that contain characters other than unaccented Roman letters (A-Z), digits (0-9), and the hyphen. For instance, `日本語.idn.icann.org` contains Japanese characters.\n\n`curl` features an in-memory cache for `HSTS` hosts, so subsequent `HTTP-only` requests to a hostname present in the cache will get internally \"redirected\" to the `HTTPS` version.\n\nIt was discovered that the `HSTS` mechanism could be bypassed if the hostname in the given URL first uses `IDN` characters that get replaced with ASCII counterparts as part of the `IDN` conversion. Like using the UTF-8 character `U+3002` (IDEOGRAPHIC FULL STOP) instead of the common `ASCII` full stop (U+002E) `.`. Then in a subsequent request, it does not detect the `HSTS` state and makes a clear text transfer. \n\nThe vulnerability is exploitable only when `curl` is executed with the non-default `--hsts` option.\n\nExample command-line usage that can trigger this issue -\n```\ncurl -v --hsts hsts.txt https://accounts.google.com。\ncurl -v --hsts hsts.txt http://accounts.google.com。\n```",

For example the environment variables `http_proxy`, `HTTPS_PROXY` or `ALL_PROXY`.\n\n\nThe `curl` CLI tool is only vulnerable if any of the following conditions are true -\n\n* Executed with `--socks5-hostname` flag\n* Executed with `--proxy` (`-x`) or `--preproxy` set to use the scheme `socks5h://`\n* Executed with relevant environment variables as described above\n\nExample of a vulnerable `curl` invocation -\n`curl -x socks5h://myproxy.com malicioushost.com`\n\nIn addition to the following conditions, the `curl` CLI tool in version 8.x  is only vulnerable if the flag `--limit-rate` is set with a number smaller than 65541.\n(To clarify, this additional condition is not required for exploitation of `libcurl` or `curl` CLI version 7.x)\n\n[An exploit](https://gist.github.com/xen0bit/0dccb11605abbeb6021963e2b1a811d3) for this vulnerability is publicly available, which demonstrates denial of service via [read-access to an attacker-controlled pointer](https://twitter.com/_JohnHammond/status/1711976730775470564/photo/1).

            "FullDescription": "[Curl](https://curl.se/) is a command-line tool for transferring data from or to a server, using various protocols like HTTP, FTP, SMTP, and more.\nIt was discovered that when connecting to a malicious HTTP server over a SOCKS5 proxy with remote hostname resolving (scheme `socks5h://`) a heap overflow can be triggered due to a long (attacker-controlled) hostname being copied to a small local heap-based buffer.\n\nThe vulnerability affects both the `curl` CLI tool and the `libcurl` library, but not under default conditions.\n\nThe `libcurl` library is only vulnerable if used in any of the following ways - \n\n* `CURLOPT_PROXYTYPE` set to type `CURLPROXY_SOCKS5_HOSTNAME`, ex. -\n`curl_easy_setopt(handle, CURLOPT_PROXYTYPE, CURLPROXY_SOCKS5_HOSTNAME)`\n\n* `CURLOPT_PROXY` or `CURLOPT_PRE_PROXY` set to use the scheme `socks5h://`, ex. -\n`curl_easy_setopt(handle, CURLOPT_PROXY, \"socks5h://...\")`\n\n* One of the proxy environment variables is set to use the `socks5h://` scheme. For example the environment variables `http_proxy`, `HTTPS_PROXY` or `ALL_PROXY`.\n\n\nThe `curl` CLI tool is only vulnerable if any of the following conditions are true -\n\n* Executed with `--socks5-hostname` flag\n* Executed with `--proxy` (`-x`) or `--preproxy` set to use the scheme `socks5h://`\n* Executed with relevant environment variables as described above\n\nExample of a vulnerable `curl` invocation -\n`curl -x socks5h://myproxy.com malicioushost.com`\n\nIn addition to the following conditions, the `curl` CLI tool in version 8.x  is only vulnerable if the flag `--limit-rate` is set with a number smaller than 65541.\n(To clarify, this additional condition is not required for exploitation of `libcurl` or `curl` CLI version 7.x)\n\n[An exploit](https://gist.github.com/xen0bit/0dccb11605abbeb6021963e2b1a811d3) for this vulnerability is publicly available, which demonstrates denial of service via [read-access to an attacker-controlled pointer](https://twitter.com/_JohnHammond/status/1711976730775470564/photo/1).
